# shuffle-game



Shuffle is an American game show that aired on The Family Channel. 





Four players competed, each with a telephone keypad built into their podium. A shuffled list with four items is given, and a question relating to the list is asked, usually in the vein of "Who is the oldest?", "Which one of these came first?", or "Which is the most popular?". The players had 10 seconds to punch in their answer (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) on their keypad. They would win points depending on how quickly they answered correctly, starting at 1,000 points and counting down as the seconds ticked on. After the right answer is revealed, they have 5 seconds to find the item ordered second. The contestants would again win points for a right answer, starting at 500 and ticking down for each passing second. After this, Wink would mention which items were ordered third and fourth, and a new list would be played.

Three lists are played this way, and the player with the lowest score at the end of three lists would be eliminated.

In the second round, the three remaining players had their scores reset to zero. Three more lists would be played, and the lowest scoring player would be eliminated.

For the third and final round, the scores were reset to zero again, and the two remaining contestants played three more lists. The contestant with the highest score at the end won two prizes, one of which was always a trip. The runner-up won a smaller prize.
